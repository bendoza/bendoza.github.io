            <li><div class="text" style="margin-top: 5;">I led the backend division of a group of four students with the goal of developing a web application during the semester. I primarily worked in Go, using a PostgreSQL database to implement all the backend functionality. Additionally, I also contributed to the Angular (Typescript) frontend to support the ongoing development process. The objective of the Vacation Planner was to provide users with relevant travel information and the ability to save and delete their preferred vacations. To achieve this, I utilized Yelp's free Fusion API to conduct searches and filter the results.</div></li>

            <li><div class="text" style="margin-top: 5;">I was the only member of the backend division among a group of two students aiming to develop a web application based on a populated database during the semester. I worked in Go with an Oracle SQL database to provide all of the backend functionality. Additionally, I provided functionality within the React (Typescript) frontend to assist my group partner during development.</div></li>
            <li><div class="text" style="margin-top: 5;">The purpose of WhatIf was to provide users with the ability to seamlessly search past cryptocurrency data. Users could select their coins, specify the amount of each coin, and choose a date range to find interesting (and potentially concerning) investment statistics based on their search queries. To accomplish this, I obtained a comprehensive dataset of historical crypto data, consisting of over half a million values, to populate the database.</div></li>

            Recently, I have been highly engaged in the world of software development/engineering. However, I have always been passionate about staying active, continuously improving myself, and traveling. Most importantly, I thoroughly enjoy spending time with the people who are dear to me, such as my childhood friends and my wonderful girlfriend, Asia.

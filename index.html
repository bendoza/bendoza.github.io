            enjoyed the values of the results from. We accomplished this mainly by contacting Yelp's free Fusion API and filtering the search and results.</div>

            also provided functionality within the React (Typescript) frontend to aid my group partners through development. The purpose of WhatIf was to provide users with the ability to search passed Crypto Currency data seamlessly. We allow a user to select their coins, their amount of each coin,
            and a date range in order to find cool (and potentially sad) investment statistics based on their search queries. We accomplished this by obtaining a nice data set of historical crypto data, with over half of a million values in it to populate our database.</div>
